# Info for Charities

Do you want to set up Help-a-Family for your charitable organization?

Then you've come to the right place :\)

### How can I use help-a-family for my charity?

You can use it to set up a website like helpafamily.example.com, where example.com is your charity's domain name.

Soon, you'll also be able to add cards to helpafamily.margaritahumanitarian.org so people can help your charity. We're not set up for that yet, but it's in the works.

### Do I need to know how to code?

Right now, setting this up requires someone with JavaScript knowledge.

In the future, we may make it possible to set up without any coding knowledge, though.

### I have other questions. How can I get in touch?

Email hi@mhfcares.org with:

* Your name
* Your charity's website address
* Your use case for the Help-a-Family project
* Your questions
* List any other ways you think we might be able help your organization. We love making new partnerships with other charities and helping however we can!

# Info for API Users

We're still putting together the Help-a-Family developer APIs.

We need your help:

* What use cases for an API would you like us to support?
* What are you working on?

Join us in chat at [https://app.element.io/\#/room/\#mhf:matrix.org](https://app.element.io/#/room/#mhf:matrix.org) and tell us more.

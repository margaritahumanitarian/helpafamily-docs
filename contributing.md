# Contributing

This file is still a work-in-progress.

We're still exploring what's the best way for volunteers to contribute to a GitBook project. If you have any ideas, kindly submit a PR to update this page.

In the meantime, see the main Help-a-Family project's [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/margaritahumanitarian/helpafamily/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) file.

# Help-a-Family Manual

Hi! This is our new manual for the Help-a-Family project.

Help-a-Family is a piece of software that makes it easy for charitable organizations serving families in need to connect with community members who want to help families.

Help comes in the form of:

* In-kind donations of used or new supplies
* Monetary donations via credit card
* Volunteer hours given to the organization
* Help from an organization who wants to partner to help families in need

Target audiences for this documentation:

* Anyone who wants to set up an instance of the helpafamily project for a charitable organization
* Anyone who wants to contribute to the codebase of the helpafamily project
* Anyone who wants to connect a project to the helpafamily APIs \(forthcoming\)

We need your help writing documentation for Help-a-Family.

* To start, help us fill out the [Contributing instructions](contributing.md).
* Then try documenting something for any of the above target audiences.

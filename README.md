# Help a Family Docs

Hi! This is our new manual for the Help-a-Family project.

Help-a-Family is a piece of software that makes it easy for charitable organizations serving families in need to connect with community members who want to help families.

Help comes in the form of:

* In-kind donations of used or new supplies
* Monetary donations via credit card
* Volunteer hours given to the organization
* Help from an organization who wants to partner to help families in need

Target audiences for this documentation:

* Anyone who wants to set up an instance of the helpafamily project for a charitable organization
* Anyone who wants to contribute to the codebase of the helpafamily project
* Anyone who wants to connect a project to the helpafamily APIs \(forthcoming\)

We need your help writing documentation for Help-a-Family. To start:

* Follow the instructions in [Contributing to Help-a-Family](https://margaritahumanitarian.gitbook.io/help-a-family-manual/)
* Submit a PR correcting any typo you find. This will give you practice.
* Then try documenting something for any of the above target audiences.
